We constantly see people whine on twitter about how we need a platform for developers to come together and so we set out to unify things. That was the main goal here: to bring all things wonderful, together. So we brought together various features from various platforms for all the devs out there, under one roof. The premise follows these points:

- It’s a community where developers connect and thrive 👯
- For the community, by the community ❤️
- Free forever, Open sourced 👨🏾‍💻👩🏼‍💻
- Simplifies the developer community and OSS ⚡️
